## Final Model

The final trained model file (.pth) is large in size, so it is hosted on Google Drive.

## How to Run Inference

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download the model from the link above and place it in the `Final_Model/` folder

3. Run inference:
   python code/inference_v2.py

## Notes
- Model and submission files are provided via Google Drive due to GitHub size limitations.
- All training and inference code is included in the `code/` folder.
